## ðŸ§¾ Project Summary & Insights

This Superstore sales analytics project revealed valuable insights into business performance over a three-year period:

* **Strongest Performing Year:** 2004 with \$4.72M in revenue and 144 orders
* **Top Performing Product:** S18\_3232 (Classic Cars) with \$288K revenue
* **Highest Spending Customer:** Euro Shopping Channel (\$912K in purchases)
* **Most Profitable Country:** USA with over \$1.46M in estimated profit
* **Loss-Making Segments:** None identifiedâ€”all product lines showed positive returns
* **Key Seasonal Trends:** Peak sales consistently observed in November and October
* **Pricing Insight:** 'Trains' category showed unusually high discount behavior (negative margin) possibly due to data or pricing errors

The dashboard supports decision-makers in identifying which product categories and regions to prioritize, when seasonal marketing campaigns are most effective, and where pricing strategy may need adjustment.

This project is a strong demonstration of my capabilities in full-stack data analytics â€” from data cleaning and SQL querying to dashboard design and data storytelling.
